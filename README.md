# Haskell Study Guide

## What is it?

This is a multi-week study plan for going from web developer (self-taught, no experience with functional programming) to a software developer that is proficient in haskell.

## Table of Contents

- [What is it?](#what-is-it)
- [Why use it?](#why-use-it)
- [How to use it](#how-to-use-it)
- [Don't feel you aren't smart enough](#dont-feel-you-arent-smart-enough)
- [Before you Get Started](#before-you-get-started)
- [What you Won't See Covered](#what-you-wont-see-covered)
- [Prerequisite Knowledge](#prerequisite-knowledge)
- [The Daily Plan](#the-daily-plan)

## Why use it?

"list=refl
functor=lift a function into a context, eg list
applicative=same but the function can have any number of args
monad=functor but you're allowed to squish it when nested. Use it to chain exprs with functor results
comonad=you don't need it
traversable=the FP cheat code"

## How to use it

<details>
<summary>How to use it</summary>

Everything below is an outline, and you should tackle the items in order from top to bottom.

I'm using Github's special markdown flavor, including tasks lists to check progress.

**Create a new branch so you can check items like this, just put an x in the brackets: [x]**


    Fork a branch and follow the commands below

`git checkout -b progress`

`git remote add jwasham https://github.com/haskellguide/haskell-study-guide`

`git fetch --all`

    Mark all boxes with X after you completed your changes

`git add . `

`git commit -m "Marked x" `

`git rebase jwasham/master `

`git push --force `

## Don't feel you aren't smart enough
- Successful software engineers are smart, but many have an insecurity that they aren't smart enough.
- [The myth of the Genius Programmer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SARbwvhupQ)
- [It's Dangerous to Go Alone: Battling the Invisible Monsters in Tech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1i8ylq4j_EY)
- [Believe you can change](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/dweck)

## What you won't see covered

These are prevalent technologies but not part of this study plan:

- SQL
- Javascript
- HTML, CSS, and other front-end technologies

## The Daily Plan

Some subjects take one day, and some will take multiple days. Some are just learning with nothing to implement.


## Prerequisite Knowledge

<details>
<summary>Prerequisite Knowledge</summary>

- [ ] **Learn C**
    - C is everywhere. You'll see examples in books, lectures, videos, *everywhere* while you're studying.
    - [ ] [C Programming Language, Vol 2](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Language-Brian-W-Kernighan/dp/0131103628)
        - This is a short book, but it will give you a great handle on the C language and if you practice it a little
            you'll quickly get proficient. Understanding C helps you understand how programs and memory work.
