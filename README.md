## Why use it?


## How to use it

<details>
<summary>How to use it</summary>

Everything below is an outline, and you should tackle the items in order from top to bottom.

I'm using Github's special markdown flavor, including tasks lists to check progress.

**Create a new branch so you can check items like this, just put an x in the brackets: [x]**


    Fork a branch and follow the commands below

`git checkout -b progress`

`git remote add jwasham https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university`

`git fetch --all`

    Mark all boxes with X after you completed your changes

`git add . `

`git commit -m "Marked x" `

`git rebase jwasham/master `

`git push --force `

## Don't feel you aren't smart enough
- Successful software engineers are smart, but many have an insecurity that they aren't smart enough.

- [It's Dangerous to Go Alone: Battling the Invisible Monsters in Tech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1i8ylq4j_EY)
- [Believe you can change](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/dweck)

## What you won't see covered

These are prevalent technologies but not part of this study plan:

- SQL
- Javascript
- HTML, CSS, and other front-end technologies

## The Daily Plan

Some subjects take one day, and some will take multiple days. Some are just learning with nothing to implement.


## Prerequisite Knowledge

<details>
<summary>Prerequisite Knowledge</summary>

- [ ] **Learn C**
    - C is everywhere. You'll see examples in books, lectures, videos, *everywhere* while you're studying.
    - [ ] [C Programming Language, Vol 2](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Language-Brian-W-Kernighan/dp/0131103628)
        - This is a short book, but it will give you a great handle on the C language and if you practice it a little
            you'll quickly get proficient. Understanding C helps you understand how programs and memory work.

- [ ] **How computers process a program:**
    - [ ] [How CPU executes a program](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XM4lGflQFvA)
    - [ ] [How computers calculate - ALU (video)](https://youtu.be/1I5ZMmrOfnA)
    - [ ] [Registers and RAM (video)](https://youtu.be/fpnE6UAfbtU)
    - [ ] [The Central Processing Unit (CPU) (video)](https://youtu.be/FZGugFqdr60)
